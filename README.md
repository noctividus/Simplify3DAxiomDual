# Simplify3DAxiomDual
Simplify 3D FFF Profile for the Airwolf Axiom Dual Printer

Goals: Fast start-up, good dual prints.

Current State: Functions well for single extruder prints. Dual prints could use a little tuning for better finishes. Only tested with ABS, although PLA should work.

TODO: Fine tune dual color support
