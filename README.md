# Simplify3DAxiomDual
Simplify 3D FFF Profile for the Airwolf Axiom Dual Printer

Goals: Fast start-up, good dual prints.

Current State: Functions well for single extruder prints. Dual prints could use a little tuning for better finishes. Nothing done for profiles other than "Standard" print. Only tested with ABS.

TODO: Display accurate layer count
TODO: Fine tune purge, possibly remove skirt
TODO: Fine tune other quality profiles
TODO: Fine tune dual color support
TODO: Add support for PLA
